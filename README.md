### Dot Files
These are some dot files (like .git) that I want to keep track and replicate on other computers.

The more useful portion is the configuraton for [fish shell](http://fishshell.com/).

IMPORTANT: To get the full effect of the fish shell prompt you'll need Powerline Fonts. I've used [these](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) and settled with Menlo for now.
